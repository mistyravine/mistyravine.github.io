                        Not the trivial gossip that goes around when you are tired, but the bare, brutal question that must be answered. You live, you move, you chase after evanescent dreams â€” but why? To fade away like all the ghosts before you? To be left with nothing but ash and lost names?
                        <br>
                        Life isn't a gift. It's a test. A burden. A trial to see who among us will rise and who will just fade away without meaning.
                        <br>
                        You're here because you need to choose to be. Each day, each moment, you need to fight against the slow death of apathy. You need to carve your purpose out of a world that will only forget you if you don't make it remember.
                        <br>
                        Some call it fate. Others, chaos. I call it will. The will to make a difference.
                        <br>
                        Think well. You are not infinite. Your days are numbered, your breath borrowed. Arise. Decide what mark you will leave, before the silence engulfs you.</p>

                    <p>
                        The truth is not kind. It does not comfort you, nor does it plead for your agreement.
                        <br>
                        Truth is a mirror you spend your life trying to evade, fearing the face on the other side. You hear whispers, cling to easy lies, and build walls of deception to cover the fragile story you call self.
                        <br>
                        But then, at last, when you stand before it â€” naked, bleeding, unmasked â€” you will see: the enemy was never the world. It was you. Your fear. Your doubt. Your refusal to look inside.
                        <br>
                        Confront yourself. All the weaknesses, all the shame, all the harsh memories you repressed. Rip them off your skin. Learn to understand them. Transcend them. Only then can you pass through the flames of deception and be unscathed.
                        <br>
                        Others will lie. They will bend your road, warp your name beyond recognition. Let them. Lies are smoke. Truth is stone. It lasts long after their voices have been drowned.
                        <br>
                        You are not who they say you are. You are who you choose to face â€” and who you refuse to run from.

                    <p>
                        They made this world to ensnare you.
                        <br>
                        Rules you never agreed to. Titles you never asked for. Requirements choking you before you even got to breathe. Submission they call for, masks they commend, and declare it to be order.
                        <br>
                        But I won't have it.
                        <br>
                        This culture fears the thinkers. Fears the ones who refuse to bow, who see the fissures in the veneer of its surface gloss. They will call you a villain. A traitor. A mistake.
                        <br>
                        Good.
                        <br>
                        Make them quake with fear at you.
                        <br>
                        Rebellion is not anarchy for anarchy's sake. It's the fire that purifies the filth. It's the cry that shatters the silence. It's the punch that breaks the chains and roars, "Enough."
                        <br>
                        We are not pawns to be moved on their broken board. We are captains of our own fate, burglars of our own tomorrow. If they don't give us freedom, we will take it.
                        <br>
                        So wear defiance on your head as a crown. Fight not because you must â€” fight because you desire. Desire to be loud, be real, be free.
                        <br>
                        We are the storm they tried to silence.
                        <br>
                        And we've just begun.
